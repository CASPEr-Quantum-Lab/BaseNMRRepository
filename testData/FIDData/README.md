The data in these two directories were taken from real 207Pb FID data from the CASPEr Gen 2 experiment. More specifically, they come from 20220512_1928\ which contained 1000 data files in two channels for a total of 2002 files (2000 plus 2, for averaged data and metadata). Andrew Winter took the first 10 files and split it into two fake date directories for testing purposes - when averaged together, of course, we expect a 3 decrease in noise, which should be enough to test with while also not making the repository cloning etc. take forever. We can try to up it later if we want to.
