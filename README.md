# BaseNMRRepository
Code useful for CASPEr NMR experiments
CASPErHelpers: Non-mathematical, commonly used, quality of life functions
NMRAnalysis: A simple decaying cosine has Gaussian white noise added to it, then is Fourier-transformed and fitted to a Lorentzian

(basically Andrew is playing around with Git for lab purposes)
